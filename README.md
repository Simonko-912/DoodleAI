DoodleAI is an interactive platform that allows users to draw and train an AI to recognize their sketches. It's a fun way to explore machine learning and create custom datasets.

## Features
Draw and Guess: Create drawings on a 500x500 canvas and let the AI guess what it is.
Training: Label your drawings and submit them to improve the AIâ€™s accuracy.
Voice Feedback: The AI speaks its guess using text-to-speech.
